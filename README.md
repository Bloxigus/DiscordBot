This is the source code for a Discord bot the [SkyHanni](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni) staff uses on the [SkyHanni Support Server](https://discord.gg/skyhanni-997079228510117908).

## Technical Infos
This Discord bot is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).  
We use [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) to communicate with the Discord Bot API.  
We use [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to parse the JSON responses from the APIs provided by [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).  
We use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to store the information locally.
